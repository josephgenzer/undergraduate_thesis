# Spectral Analysis of Multiscale Sample Covariance Matrices
This project was completed as my senior honors thesis in mathematics during my undergrad. It investigates the spectral properties of multiscale sample covariance matrices across low- and high-dimensional regimes, with a focus on dependence structures modeled by fractional Brownian motion. By combining theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations, I was able to identify distinct universality classes in the eigenvalue fluctuations of multiscale sample covariance matrices, including asymptotically Gaussian and beta-Hermite-type regimes, driven by the interplay of dependence and dimensionality. The code folder contains the R scripts used to generate the simulations and figures in the thesis.
